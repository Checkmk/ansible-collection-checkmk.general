# Getting help

Please be aware, that although the content in this repository is maintained and
curated by Checkmk, it is fully open source and there is no commercial support whatsoever!
This is just a side project and we can only work on this on a **part time and best effort basis**.

Of course you can reach out in the [Checkmk Community (using the 'ansible' tag)](https://forum.checkmk.com/tag/ansible)
or create [issues here](https://github.com/Checkmk/ansible-collection-checkmk.general/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).

# Compatibility Matrix
The following is a compatibility overview between this collection and Checkmk. We always try to track the most recent Checkmk version. This table will give you an overview which collection versions were tested against which Checkmk versions.
There is of course no guarantees, that there will be no issues at all, but we do our best in testing. On the other hand this obviously does not limit the collection versions to the Checkmk versions mentioned here. Most likely the collection will work with most current Checkmk versions.
