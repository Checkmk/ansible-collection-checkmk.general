# checkmk.general.agent

This role installs and manages Checkmk agents.

## Requirements

The Checkmk Ansible Collection from which this role originates is needed to
use it, as modules shipped by this collection are used in the role.

It can be installed as easy as running:

    ansible-galaxy collection install checkmk.general

Additionally, this role requires the Python module `netaddr` on the controller.
Please make sure it is installed on your system and available for Ansible.

## Role Variables

    checkmk_agent_version: "2.3.0p6"

The Checkmk version of the site your agents will talk to.

    checkmk_agent_edition: cre

The edition you are using. Valid values are `cre`, `cfe`, `cee`, `cce` and `cme`.

- `cre`: Raw Edition, fully open source.
- `cfe`: Free Edition, enterprise features, but limited hosts. **Only available until Checkmk 2.1!** For Checkmk 2.2, see `cce`.
- `cee`: Enterprise Edition, full enterprise features.
- `cce`: Cloud Edition, for cloud natives. Includes all enterprise features, and a free tier for a limited number of services.
- `cme`: Managed Edition, for service providers.

For details about the editions see: https://checkmk.com/product/editions

    checkmk_agent_server_protocol: http

The protocol used to connect to your Checkmk site.
This is used both for API calls and agent updates.

    checkmk_agent_server: localhost

The FQDN or IP address of your Checkmk server.

    checkmk_agent_server_validate_certs: 'true'

Whether to validate the SSL certificate of the Checkmk server.

    checkmk_agent_server_port: "{% if checkmk_agent_server_protocol == 'https' %}443{% else %}80{% endif %}"

The port of the web interface of your Checkmk server. Defaults to port 80 for http and port 443 for https.

    checkmk_agent_site: mysite

The name of your Checkmk site.

    checkmk_agent_registration_server: "{{ checkmk_agent_server }}"

The server you want to use for registration tasks (Agent updates and TLS encryption). Defaults to `{{ checkmk_agent_server }}`.

    checkmk_agent_registration_site: "{{ checkmk_agent_site }}"

The site you want to use for registration tasks (Agent updates and TLS encryption). Defaults to `{{ checkmk_agent_site }}`.

    checkmk_agent_user: myuser

The user used to authenticate against your Checkmk site.

    checkmk_agent_pass: mysecret

The password for the normal user used to authenticate against your Checkmk site, both for API calls and agent updates.
This is mutually exclusive with `checkmk_agent_secret`.

    checkmk_agent_secret: mysecret

The secret for the automation user used to authenticate against your Checkmk site, both for API calls and agent updates.
This is mutually exclusive with `checkmk_agent_pass`.

    checkmk_agent_port: 6556

Configure the port the agent listens on. We recommend to stick to the default.
**This does not change the agent configuration! It merely tells Ansible which port to talk to.**

    checkmk_agent_auto_activate: 'false'

Enable automatic activation of changes on all sites.
This is disabled by default, as it might be unexpected.

    checkmk_agent_force_foreign_changes: 'false'

Allow forcing foreign changes on activation by handler.

    checkmk_agent_add_host: 'false'

Automatically add the host where the agent was installed on to Checkmk.

    checkmk_agent_host_name: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"

Define the hostname which will be used to add the host to Checkmk.

    checkmk_agent_folder: "/"

The folder into which the automatically created host will be placed.

    checkmk_agent_host_ip: "{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname]['ansible_default_ipv4']['address'] }}"

Define an IP address which will be added to the host in Checkmk. This is optional, as long as the hostname is DNS-resolvable.

    checkmk_agent_host_attributes:
        ipaddress: "{{ checkmk_agent_host_ip | default(omit) }}"

Define attributes with which the host will be added to Checkmk.

    checkmk_agent_discover: 'false'

Automatically discover services on the host where the agent was installed.

    checkmk_agent_discover_max_parallel_tasks: 0

When this parameter is greater then zero, then only the defined number of
discovery tasks run at the same time in parallel.

    checkmk_agent_update: 'false'

Register host for automatic updates. Make sure to have the server side prepared for automatic updates. Otherwise this will fail.
See [this link](hhttps://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/agent_deployment.html) for more information on the preparations.

    checkmk_agent_tls: 'false'

Register for TLS encryption. Make sure to have the server side prepared for automatic updates. Otherwise this will fail.
See [this link](https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/agent_linux.html#registration) for more information on the preparations.

    checkmk_agent_configure_firewall: 'true'

Automatically configure the firewall (*currently only on RedHat and Debian derivatives*) to allow access to the Checkmk agent.

    checkmk_agent_configure_firewall_zone: 'public'

When checkmk_agent_configure_firewall is set to `true` then configure the firewall zone on RedHat derivatives. Defaults to 'public'.

    checkmk_agent_server_ips: []

A list of IP addresses, that will be whitelisted in the firewall for agent access on `checkmk_agent_port`.
The `checkmk_agent_server` will automatically be added, but only if it is an IP address.
This parameter also does **not** take care of any agent-side whitelisting!

    checkmk_agent_force_install: 'false'

Force the installation of the agent package, no matter the constraints.
This means, downgrades become possible and unverified packages would be installed.

    checkmk_agent_prep_legacy: 'false'

Enable this to automatically install `xinetd` on hosts with systemd prior to version 220.

    checkmk_agent_delegate_api_calls: localhost

Configure the host to which Checkmk API calls are delegated to.
Typically this would be your Ansible host, hence the default `localhost`.

    checkmk_agent_delegate_download: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"

Configure the host to which downloads are delegated to. After download the files are transferred to the remote node, when the remote node didn't do the download itself.

    checkmk_agent_mode: pull

The mode the agent operates in. For most deployments, this will be the `pull` mode.
If you are uncertain, what you are using, this is most likely your mode.
If you are using an alternative way to call the agent, e.g. SSH, you can set the variable to `ssh`, so the agent port check is skipped.
If you are using the Checkmk Cloud Edition (CCE) with an agent in `push` mode, you want to set this to `push` to avoid the agent port check, as well as triggering an initial push of data.

    checkmk_agent_no_log: 'true'

Whether to log sensitive information like passwords, Ansible output will be censored for enhanced security by default. Set to `false` for easier troubleshooting. Be careful when changing this value in production, passwords may be leaked in operating system logs.
