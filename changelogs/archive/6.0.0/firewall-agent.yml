breaking_changes:
  - Agent role - Remove advanced firewall configuration options and revert to basic firewall management.
    If you used the `checkmk_agent_server_ips` or `checkmk_agent_configure_firewall_zone` option, you need to take action.
    Refer to the README for details.
    If you need elaborate firewall management, use a dedicated role!
