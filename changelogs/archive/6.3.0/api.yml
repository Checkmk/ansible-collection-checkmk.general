minor_changes:
  - Authentication - Thanks to Atruvia AG (https://atruvia.de/), all modules now support two more modes of authentication.
    In addition to ``bearer``, you can now use both ``basic`` and ``cookie`` authentication.
    Refer to the respective module documentation for details.
  - Idempotency - Differences in the desired and current state are currently computed in each module separately.
    Thanks to Atruvia AG (https://atruvia.de/) there now is a ``ConfigDiffer`` class, which can be used for this moving forward.
