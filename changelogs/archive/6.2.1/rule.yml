bugfixes:
  - Rule module - The `rule` module used a function called `safe_eval` from the Ansible utils,
    which provided a safer `eval` function especially for older Python versions. The function is deprecated,
    as in recent Python versions (all currently supported), there is `literal_eval`,
    which has the same security features. This function is used now.
