bugfixes:
  - Server role - The MKP management was using 'omd su site -c' to execute commands as site user but it does not work in all flavors/versions so changed to become_user instead.
  - Server role - The MKP management failed when try to install a mkp packages that already exists in the server. Added a conditional to validate stderr and don't fail if "exists on the site" is found.
  - Server role - The MKP management expects a boolean value for __mkp.installed and __mkp.enabled but in README.md and defaults.yml the usage examples set them as string. Changed README.md but also added "| bool" to force boolean even if string is defined.
