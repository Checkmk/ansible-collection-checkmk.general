    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - Folder module - The module options 'attributes', 'update_attributes' and 'remove_attributes'

  3.2.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Agent role - Fix activation handler URL.
      - Agent role - Fix agent and update registration on remote sites.
      minor_changes:

  3.3.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Agent role - Performing the agent registration on a remote would fail, if
        the host was just created. This release introduces a workaround to enable
        this.
      - Folder module - When creating a new folder with "attributes" parameter, the
        attributes were ignored. This is now fixed.
      known_issues:
      - Server role - Not having to provide an admin password introduces a problem
        though, as users could create sites without knowing the randomly generated
        password. A task is introduced to mitigate this, but the solution there could
        be improved.
      major_changes:
      - Folder lookup plugin - Look up the configuration of a folder.
      - Folders lookup plugin - Look up all folders.

  4.0.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - Agent role - We restructured the agent. That entails a lot of changes, and
        we tried to keep everything stable. However, we cannot guarantee stability
        as we do not know all use-cases out there. Hence this change is also considered
        breaking.
      - Server role - It became necessary to make the way states are handled more
        consistent. The most siginificant change is, that all sites not in state "started"
        will be stopped. For all other states please consult the role's README.
      - Variable names - We aligned the names of variables throughout the collection.
        This can impact your existing configuration. Please review the variable names
        and apapt your configuration accordingly. For more details see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
      major_changes:
      - Bakery lookup plugin - Get the status of the Checkmk Agent Bakery.
      minor_changes:
      - Activation module - Implement proper support for `redirect` parameter. This
        means, the activation module can now optionally wait for a completed activation
        or just trigger it and move on.
      - Discovery module - Print error message, when using state "tabula_rasa" in
        bulk discovery mode, because that state is not supported by the API.
      - Lookup API - Add improved error handling.
