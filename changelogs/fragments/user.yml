minor_changes:
  - User module - Checkmk 2.5.0 renames the ``mega_menu_icons`` parameter of the user management REST API endpoints.
    The new name ``main_menu_icons`` will be used by the user module for Checkmk 2.5.0, while the old name is used for earlier versions of Checkmk.
    The old name remains as an alias in Checkmk 2.5.0, so that it should still work with older versions of this collection for now.

major_changes:
  - User module - The parameter ``auth_type`` now uses ``password`` as the default value.
    In most situations omitting the parameter was no problem at all, but it could fail in certain scenarios.
    Now the module will default to password authentication, if not defined otherwise.
