breaking_changes:
  - Rename authentication variables ``automation_user`` to ``api_user`` and ``automation_secret`` to ``api_secret``.
    This includes the internal variables ``checkmk_var_automation_user`` and ``checkmk_var_automation_secret`` as well.
    In all instances, ``automation_`` was renamed to ``api_``.
    Update your configuration accordingly.
  - Lookup modules - Remove obsolete ``ANSIBLE_LOOKUP_`` environment variables and ``ansible_lookup_`` ansible variables.
    These were marked as obsolete already in ``5.11.0``. If you used this naming,
    use the new ``checkmk_var_`` naming instead, as the obsolete variable pattern is discouraged by the Ansible project.

minor_changes:
  - Aliases - The old names ``automation_user`` and ``automation_secret`` are retained as aliases for a while.
    This is a temporary measure and is only supposed to ease the migration. Do not rely on these aliases!
