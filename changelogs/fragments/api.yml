minor_changes:
  - All modules - Change API call timeout to 60 seconds and retry to 1 to avoid server overload.
    This is a temporary measure, as currently repeating the same expensive query on an already
    overloaded server several times does actually worsen the situation. As soon as this is fixed
    upstream, we will re-establish the original back-off mechanism.
