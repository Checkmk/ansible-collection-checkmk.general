bugfixes:
  - Agent role - For Windows hosts the download of correct setup files was broken
    due to a mixup in the modules used to fetch the files. The role would always
    fall back to the GENERIC agent, even if a specific agent was available.
    This is fixed now.

minor_changes:
  - Agent role - Improve idempotency by reading the registration states both for
    Agent registration and Updater registration and skipping the registration
    if it is not necessary.
