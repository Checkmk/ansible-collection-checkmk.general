major_changes:
  - Server role - Introduce initial support for Suse derivatives.
    Observe the "Known Issues", as this support is experimental!

known_issues:
  - Server role - Suse support is currently tested only on openSUSE Leap 15. This means, that it is not tested on actual SLES.
    If you have any interest in this functionality and have a SLES 15 handy, we are happy to collaborate on this.
  - Server role - SLES has dependencies, which cannot be managed by this role. Refer to the role README for details.
  - Server role - Suse support does not yet cover the new version scheme starting with SLES 16.
    As soon as Checkmk supports SLES 16, we will look into updating the role accordingly.
