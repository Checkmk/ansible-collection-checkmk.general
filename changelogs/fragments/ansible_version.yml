minor_changes:
  - Bump minimum `ansible-core` version to `2.17`, as that is the oldest version we test against.
    Chances are, that older versions of `ansible-core` still work, but we do not verify that.
    So you could manually change `meta/runtime.yml` to circumvent this limitation, but we do recommend
    using up-to-date `ansible-core` versions.
  - Bump project `ansible-core` to `2.19`. This is used for development and testing.
    We do recommend to use the latest stable `ansible-core` version, but that is up to you.
    The only limit we impose, is the minimum version in `meta/runtime.yml` but that can be circumvented as well.
