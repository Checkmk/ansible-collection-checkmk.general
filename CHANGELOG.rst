checkmk.general Release Notes
=============================

.. contents:: Topics

v5.1.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Some love for the agent role.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Agent role - All internal variables are now prefixed with a double underscore (`__`). If you hooked into any variable, which is not in `defaults/main.yml` you need to check your inventory. Be advised, that it is bad practice, to use internal variables directly.
- Agent role - Improve idempotency by reading the registration states both for Agent registration and Updater registration and skipping the registration if it is not necessary.
- Server role - All internal variables are now prefixed with a double underscore (`__`). If you hooked into any variable, which is not in `defaults/main.yml` you need to check your inventory. Be advised, that it is bad practice, to use internal variables directly.
- Testing - Testing against Python 3.8 was removed for all modules.

Bugfixes
--------

- Agent role - For Windows hosts the download of correct setup files was broken due to a mixup in the modules used to fetch the files. The role would always fall back to the GENERIC agent, even if a specific agent was available. This is fixed now.

v5.0.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

(Re)writing history with overhauled modules and updated Checkmk, Ansible, Distribution and Python support.

Major Changes
-------------

- Discovery module - The module now fully supports Checkmk 2.3.0. Additionally, two new parameters were introduced, `update_service_labels` and `monitor_undecided_services`. Refer to the module documentation for further details.
- Rule module - The complete module was rewritten to use the new module API. Additionally, a parameter "rule_id" was introduced to modify existing rules. Refer to the module documentation for further details.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Agent role - Add support to open firewall for a list of IPs.
- Agent role - Replace `ansible.builtin.yum` with the succeeding `ansible.builtin.dnf`.
- Server role - Replace `ansible.builtin.yum` with the succeeding `ansible.builtin.dnf`.
- Several modules - Remove unnecessary HTTP codes which get already imported via utils.py.
- Testing - Add Ansible 2.17 to all tests. Be advised, that this Ansible release drops support for Python 2.7 and 3.6.
- Testing - Add Ubuntu 24.04 to the Molecule tests.
- Testing - All tests now cover Checkmk 2.3.0.
- Testing - Remove Ansible 2.14 from all tests, as it is EOL.
- Testing - Remove Checkmk 2.0.0 from all tests, as it is EOL.
- Testing - The Molecule tests now run on Ubuntu 22.04.

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- Agent role - Not really a breaking change, but we removed the internal variable `checkmk_agent_server_ip`. If you set this variable in your inventory, please make sure to update your configuration accordingly!
- Folder lookup module - Return the complete folder information, not only the extensions. To keep the current behavior in your playbooks, you want to use `{{ my_lookup_result.extensions }}` instead of `{{ my_lookup_result }}`.

v4.4.1

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide

- Server role - It became necessary to make the way states are handled more consistent. The most siginificant change is, that all sites not in state "started" will be stopped. For all other states please consult the role's README.
