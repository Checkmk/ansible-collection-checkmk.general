# By default, non-boolean conditionals result in an error.

# Second, string constants in conditionals (for example, ``when: some_var == '{{ some_other_var }}'``).
# Finally, positional arguments to lookups (for example, ``lookup('pipe', 'echo {{ some_var }}')``).
# This feature is deprecated, since embedded templates are unnecessary in these cases.
# When disabled, use of embedded templates will result in an error.

# (boolean) When enabled, this option allows lookup plugins (whether used in variables as ``{{lookup('foo')}}`` or as a loop as with_foo) to return data that is not marked 'unsafe'.
# By default, such data is marked as unsafe to prevent the templating engine from evaluating any jinja2 templating language, as this could represent a security risk.

;gathering=implicit
gathering=smart

# (string) This setting controls how duplicate definitions of dictionary variables (aka hash, map, associative array) are handled in Ansible.
# This does not affect variables whose values are scalars (integers, strings) or arrays.
# **WARNING**, changing this setting is not recommended as this is fragile and makes your content (plays, roles, collections) nonportable, leading to continual confusion and misuse. Don't change this setting unless you think you have an absolute need for it.
# We recommend avoiding reusing variable names and relying on the ``combine`` filter and ``vars`` and ``varnames`` lookups to create merged versions of the individual variables. In our experience, this is rarely needed and is a sign that too much complexity has been introduced into the data structures and plays.
# For some uses you can also look into custom vars_plugins to merge on input, even substituting the default ``host_group_vars`` that is in charge of parsing the ``host_vars/`` and ``group_vars/`` directories. Most users of this setting are only interested in inventory scope, but the setting itself affects all sources and makes debugging even harder.
# All playbooks and roles in the official examples repos assume the default for this setting.
# Changing the setting to ``merge`` applies across variable sources, but many sources will internally still overwrite the variables. For example ``include_vars`` will dedupe variables internally before updating Ansible, with 'last defined' overwriting previous definitions in same file.
# The Ansible project recommends you **avoid ``merge`` for new projects.**
# It is the intention of the Ansible developers to eventually deprecate and remove this setting, but it is being kept as some users do heavily rely on it. New projects should **avoid 'merge'**.

If you didn't then ``ansible-playbook`` uses the task's action to help you tell which task is presently running. Sometimes you run many of the same action and so you want more information about the task to differentiate it from others of the same action.

The fallback behavior will issue a warning that the interpreter should be set explicitly (since interpreters installed later may change which one is used). This warning behavior can be disabled by setting ``auto_silent``. The ``auto_legacy`` modes are deprecated and behave the same as their respective ``auto`` modes.

# Pipelining, if supported by the connection plugin, reduces the number of network operations required to execute a module on the remote server, by executing many Ansible modules without actual file transfer.
# It can result in a very significant performance improvement when enabled.
# However this conflicts with privilege escalation (become). For example, when using 'sudo:' operations you must first disable 'requiretty' in /etc/sudoers on all managed hosts, which is why it is disabled by default.
