# tribe29 Checkmk Collection

Checkmk already provides the needed APIs to automate and 
configure your monitoring. With this project we want to create
and share modules and roles for Ansible to both simplify your first steps
with automating Checkmk and keep your daily operations smooth and efficient.

## Here be dragons!

This repository is provided as is and we cannot guarantee stability at this point.
Additionally, there is no commercial support whatsoever!
This is an open source endeavour, which we want to share and progress with the community.

This repository is a successor to [ansible-checkmk](https://github.com/tribe29/ansible-checkmk)
in a way, that we take the idea of the initial repository and translate it into
todays format. We will try to keep you posted as best as we can.
Also, keep an eye on [this Checkmk forum post](https://forum.checkmk.com/t/checkmk-goes-ansible/25428) for updates.

## Dependencies
 - [ansible.posix](https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.posix)
 - [community.general](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general)

Although the Ansible project notes, that collections should have no or very little dependencies, we want to make sure the  collection works for you out-of-the-box. Currently we only depend on very basic collections, which are most likely already installed in your environment. For version constraints, see [galaxy.yml](galaxy.yml).

## Getting help

For documentation on the [included modules](#modules), run the following
command substituting the $MODULE_NAME:

    ansible-doc tribe29.checkmk.$MODULE_NAME

For any form of support queries or requests refer to [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md).
