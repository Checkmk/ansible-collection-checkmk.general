# Security Policy

## Disambiguation
This policy solely applies to the Checkmk Ansible Collection, not Checkmk itself!
For Checkmk itself, please refer to [this Vulnerability disclosure policy](https://checkmk.com/responsible-disclosure-policy)

## Supported Versions

Please always use the latest available version!  
Versions in this repository are used solely for stability, so your Ansible configuration
does not break.  
However, we cannot and will not support older versions, especially security-wise.  
If you find a vulnerability, please report it as stated below,
and we will do our best to fix it in the next release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For now, please open a normal [issue](https://github.com/Checkmk/ansible-collection-checkmk.general/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) in the repository but try to disclose the
vulnerability as reasonable as possible.
