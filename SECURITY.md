# Security policy

## Disambiguation

This policy solely applies to the Checkmk Ansible Collection, not Checkmk itself!
For Checkmk itself, refer to [this Vulnerability disclosure policy](https://checkmk.com/responsible-disclosure-policy)

## Supported versions

Always use the latest available version!
Versions in this repository are used solely for stability, so your Ansible configuration
does not break.
However, we cannot and will not support older versions, especially security-wise.
If you find a vulnerability, report it as stated below, and we will do our best to fix it as soon as possible.

## Reporting a vulnerability

For now, open a normal [issue](https://github.com/Checkmk/ansible-collection-checkmk.general/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
in the repository but try to disclose the vulnerability as reasonably as possible.
